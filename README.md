## Research Backgroud

### TIPI Methodology

- **Development Background**  
  The Ten Item Personality Inventory (TIPI) is a brief and valid personality assessment tool in personality psychology. The main purpose of the TIPI is to efficiently measure five major personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, Integrity, Neuroticism, and Openness), known as the Big Five, with only 10 questions. The TIPI is a simple, easy-to-use, and easy-to-use instrument.

- **measurement method**  
  The TIPI is a self-report instrument in which subjects answer 10 questions about their own personality on a 7-point Likert scale. Each item represents two items of each of the five Big Five factors, and the questions are very brief. For example, to a question such as “I think I am active and outgoing,” subjects respond on a 7-point scale ranging from “I think not at all” to “I strongly agree.

- **Reliability and Validity**  
   Numerous studies on the psychometric properties of the TIPI have demonstrated its reliability and validity.

  - Reliability:  
    Multiple studies have confirmed that TIPI exhibits high internal agreement and retest reliability. This means that TIPI provides stable measurement results.

  - Validity:  
    The TIPI has been found to have high convergent validity, including high correlations with other longer personality tests. High criterion-related validity has also been suggested, as personality traits measured by the TIPI have been associated with actual behaviors and lifestyle habits.

- **Relation to Big Five Theory**  
  The TIPI was developed to provide a concise measure of the five major dimensions of personality, known as the Big Five; each item on the TIPI represents two items of each of the Big Five factors, and a score for each of the five factors can be calculated from the subject's responses. This makes the TIPI a convenient tool for providing a comprehensive picture of an individual's personality.
